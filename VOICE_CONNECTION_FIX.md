# Voice Connection Fix - WebSocket Error Resolution

## Problem
WebSocket connection to OpenAI Realtime API fails with generic error, preventing voice coach functionality from working.

## Root Cause
The most likely cause is missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` configuration in Supabase Edge Function secrets. WebSocket errors in browsers don't provide detailed error messages, making this difficult to diagnose.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Updated**: `src/system/services/openaiRealtimeService.ts`
  - Added detailed error logging with browser and network information
  - Enhanced error messages with troubleshooting hints
  - Added checks for common issues (offline, Supabase connection)

### 2. Pre-Connection Diagnostics
- **Updated**: `src/system/services/voiceCoachOrchestrator.ts`
  - Added automatic diagnostic checks before attempting connection
  - Shows clear error messages identifying specific failure points
  - Prevents connection attempts when prerequisites fail

### 3. Enhanced Diagnostic Utility
- **Updated**: `src/system/services/voiceConnectionDiagnostics.ts`
  - Improved WebSocket test error messages
  - Added specific guidance for OPENAI_API_KEY configuration
  - Added solution steps for each failure type

### 4. Developer Diagnostic Tools
- **New**: `src/system/services/voiceDiagnosticRunner.ts`
  - Browser console utility for running diagnostics
  - Detailed output with solutions for each failure
  - Automatically loaded in development mode

### 5. Automatic Diagnostic Loading
- **Updated**: `src/main.tsx`
  - Automatically loads diagnostic utilities in development mode
  - Makes `runVoiceDiagnostics()` available in browser console

## How to Fix the Issue

### Step 1: Run Diagnostics

Open the browser console and run:
```javascript
runVoiceDiagnostics()
```

This will check:
1. ✅ Environment variables (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
2. ✅ WebSocket API availability
3. ✅ Environment capabilities (not StackBlitz/WebContainer)
4. ✅ Edge function reachability (HTTP test)
5. ✅ Microphone permissions
6. ❌ WebSocket connection (likely to fail if OPENAI_API_KEY not set)

### Step 2: Configure OPENAI_API_KEY

If the WebSocket test fails with "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured":

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `kwipydbtjagypocpvbwn`

2. **Navigate to Edge Functions Secrets**
   - Click on "Edge Functions" in the sidebar
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Click on "Secrets" section

3. **Add OPENAI_API_KEY Secret**
   - Click "Add new secret"
   - Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)
   - Click "Save"

4. **Get OpenAI API Key**
   - If you don't have one, go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Make sure it has access to the GPT-4 Realtime API

5. **Redeploy Edge Function (if needed)**
   The edge function should automatically pick up the new secret, but if issues persist:
   ```bash
   # This is handled automatically by the MCP tool, but for reference:
   # The voice-coach-realtime function may need to be redeployed
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Fix

1. Run diagnostics again:
   ```javascript
   runVoiceDiagnostics()
   ```

2. All tests should now pass, including the WebSocket connection test

3. Try using the voice coach feature in the app

## Quick Check

For a quick status check, run in console:
```javascript
quickVoiceCheck()
```

## Understanding the Error Logs

The original error logs showed:
```
REALTIME_API — ❌ WebSocket.onerror triggered
REALTIME_API — ❌❌❌ WebSocket ERROR event ❌❌❌
VOICE_ORCHESTRATOR — ❌ Realtime API error
```

These generic errors occur when:
- The WebSocket connection is rejected by the server
- The edge function can't connect to OpenAI (missing API key)
- Network firewall blocks WebSocket connections
- The edge function encounters an internal error

The new error handling provides more specific information to identify the exact cause.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Edge function `voice-coach-realtime` is deployed (verified with MCP)
- [ ] OPENAI_API_KEY is configured in Supabase Edge Function secrets
- [x] VITE_SUPABASE_URL is set correctly in .env
- [x] VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is set correctly in .env
- [x] Enhanced error logging is in place
- [x] Pre-connection diagnostics are running
- [x] Browser console diagnostics are available

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Test
1. Open the application in browser
2. Open browser console
3. Run: `runVoiceDiagnostics()`
4. Check that all 6 tests pass
5. Try using voice coach feature
6. Verify WebSocket connects successfully

### Expected Behavior
- Diagnostics should identify missing OPENAI_API_KEY clearly
- After adding the key, WebSocket should connect successfully
- Voice coach should work without errors

## Additional Troubleshooting

### If diagnostics still fail after adding OPENAI_API_KEY:

1. **Verify API Key is Valid**
   - Test it directly at: https://platform.openai.com/playground
   - Check it has proper permissions for Realtime API

2. **Check Network Connection**
   - Ensure WebSockets aren't blocked by firewall
   - Try from different network (mobile hotspot)
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

3. **Verify Edge Function Logs**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > Logs
   - Look for errors from voice-coach-realtime function
   - Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is being read correctly

4. **Test Edge Function Directly**
   ```bash
   # From terminal with proper auth
   curl -i -N \
     -H "Connection: Upgrade" \
     -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
     -H "Host: kwipydbtjagypocpvbwn.supabase.co" \
     -H "Origin: https://kwipydbtjagypocpvbwn.supabase.co" \
     "wss://kwipydbtjagypocpvbwn.supabase.co/functions/v1/voice-coach-realtime?model=gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01&apikey=YOUR_ANON_KEY"
   ```

## Architecture Overview

```
Browser Client
    ↓ WebSocket (wss://)
Supabase Edge Function (voice-coach-realtime)
    ↓ WebSocket (wss://)
OpenAI Realtime API
```

The edge function acts as a secure proxy that:
- Keeps OPENAI_API_KEY server-side (secure)
- Handles authentication with Supabase
- Forwards WebSocket messages bidirectionally
- Manages connection lifecycle

## Files Modified

1. `src/system/services/openaiRealtimeService.ts` - Enhanced error handling
2. `src/system/services/voiceCoachOrchestrator.ts` - Added pre-connection diagnostics
3. `src/system/services/voiceConnectionDiagnostics.ts` - Enhanced diagnostics
4. `src/system/services/voiceDiagnosticRunner.ts` - New diagnostic runner
5. `src/main.tsx` - Auto-load diagnostics in dev mode

## Summary

The WebSocket connection errors are now properly diagnosed and explained. The most likely fix is adding the OPENAI_API_KEY to Supabase Edge Function secrets. The enhanced diagnostics will clearly identify this and any other issues preventing voice connections.
