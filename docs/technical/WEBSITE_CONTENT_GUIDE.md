**Body Copy**:
You track meals in one app, workouts in another, fasting in a third, and body measurements manually. Each app shows you isolated metrics, but none understand how they interact.

**Pain Points** (Icon Grid):
1. **Fragmented Data** - Juggling 5+ health apps
2. **No Context** - Insights that ignore your full picture
3. **Generic Advice** - One-size-fits-all recommendations
4. **Wasted Time** - Manual data entry across platforms
5. **Missed Patterns** - Can't see how training affects nutrition
6. **Decision Fatigue** - Too many conflicting recommendations

**Subheadline**: Individual Forges are powerful. Together with the Central Brain, they're transformative.

**Explanation**:
The Central Brain analyzes data across all your Forges to discover correlations and patterns. It learns how your training affects your nutrition needs, how fasting impacts your performance, and how sleep influences recovery.

**Example Insights** (Rotating Cards):

```
"Your training performance is 18% better when you eat
40-50g carbs 2-3 hours before workouts.
Adjust your meal timing?"
```

```
"Pattern detected: Your lean mass gains accelerate during
weeks with 3+ training sessions AND 180g+ daily protein.
Update your nutrition targets?"
```

```
"Recovery markers suggest overtraining risk.
Recommend reducing volume 20% this week and
extending fasting window for enhanced recovery."
```

## About Page (/about)

### Mission Statement

**Headline**: We're Building the Future of Personalized Health

**Body**:
TwinForge was founded on the belief that health optimization should be intelligent, integrated, and accessible. We use cutting-edge AI to make sense of complex health data, delivering insights that help you reach your goals faster.

---

### The Problem We're Solving

Most health apps treat nutrition, training, and recovery as separate silos. But your body doesn't work that way. What you eat affects how you train. How you train affects how you recover. How you recover affects what you can eat.

TwinForge is the first platform to understand these connections through AI-powered cross-system intelligence.

---

### Our Values

1. **Privacy First**: Your health data is yours. We encrypt everything, never sell data, and let you delete anytime.

2. **Science-Backed**: All algorithms based on peer-reviewed research in sports science and nutrition.

3. **Transparency**: We show you how AI makes decisions, including confidence scores and data sources.

4. **Accessibility**: From $9.99/month to enterprise solutions, TwinForge scales with you.

### Sample Case Study

**Headline**: How Marcus Lost 15kg and Maintained Strength

**Subheadline**: Using TwinForge's Central Brain to coordinate nutrition, training, and fasting

**Marcus, 34, Software Engineer**

**Starting Point**: 95kg, 22% body fat, moderate strength
**Goal**: Lose fat while maintaining muscle
**Timeframe**: 16 weeks
**Result**: 80kg, 14% body fat, +5% strength on main lifts

**The Challenge**:
Marcus had tried multiple diets but always lost muscle along with fat. He needed a coordinated approach that optimized nutrition, training, and meal timing.

**The Solution**:
Marcus used 4 Forges:
1. Nutrition Forge: Track all meals, hit protein targets
2. Training Forge: 4x/week strength program
3. Time Forge: 18:6 intermittent fasting
4. Body Forge: Monthly 3D scans

The Central Brain coordinated everything:
- Suggested higher protein on training days
- Adjusted fasting window around workouts
- Recommended deload weeks based on recovery markers

**The Results**:
- Lost 15kg in 16 weeks (0.9kg/week)
- Maintained squat, bench, deadlift strength
- Body fat: 22% → 14%
- Lean mass: 74kg → 69kg (minimal loss)

**Key Takeaway**:
"The Central Brain's recommendations to eat more carbs around workouts and extend my fast on rest days made all the difference. I finally lost fat without losing strength."
